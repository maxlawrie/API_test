# API_test
API test for the assignment

This repository contains the automated API tests that I built for the assignment.
All the automated tests are contained in the one file, test_api.py
A sample of the test results and their formatting (but without colour) is available in results.txt

Before you can run the tests, you must have python and pytest installed in your system.
Pytest can be installed from pip by running "pip install pytest"

To run the tests, either clone the repo or download test_api.py
Then from a terminal navigate to the directory containing test_api.py and run "python -m pytest -v" and the results will be displayed in the terminal
